- Hi, my name is Dylan!
- I'm a PhD student studying Biostatistics at Southern Methodist University and UT Southwestern.
- Currently, I'm learning about Bayesian methods, deep learning, and merging the two to further personlized medicine.
- The goal of this page is two fold: 
  1. Create and establish a portfolio of my projects. 
    - Research, course, and side projects. 
    - Version control. 
  2. Establish Owezone-Statistics as an open-source platform for those interested in learning the subject. 
    - The idea here is to upload my code in both R and Python for coursework and self-study problems in statistics. 
    - Topics will include simulation studies, data analysis, experimental design, ML/DL, etc. 
 - Other interests include: dogs, basketball, and guitars.
 - My linkedin and other sites will be found through www.owezone.net (under construction)
